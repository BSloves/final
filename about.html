      <h2>Early Years</h2>

          <p>I was born and raised in southern New Jersey as the middle child to two sisters. Throughout my childhood I took a likening towards math, science, and destruction. I was able to scratch the math and science itch at school, but the destruction itch was subsided after school when playing baseball and soccer. Growing up playing baseball just 20 minutes outside of Philadelphia ended up turning me into a big Philadelphia Phillies fan, specifically a Ryan Howard fan.</p>

    <h2>Growing Up</h2>
      <div class="about_row">

        <p>Once I got to the 4<sup>th</sup> grade, when the pitching got a lot faster, I quit baseball and took up lacrosse. When my dad and I went to the store to purchase the pads and equipment for lacrosse, my dad made me promise that I would play for at least 5 years. I would end up quickly becoming obsessed and play for 10 years until I went off to college.</p>

    <h2>Moving Out</h2>

        <p>After graduating from high school I decided I would move 9 hours away from home to attent the University of Cincinnati (UC) and major in Mechanical Engineering Technology. However, the moving wouldn't stop there. The UC College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) is a 5 year co-op program allowing me to complete 5 co-ops before graduation. During these co-ops I had to opportunitty to live and work in Cincinnati, Boston, St. Louis, and Minneapolis.</p>

      <div class="about_row">
        <img src="images/benheli.JPG" alt="Ben on a helicopter" class="aboutshots">
        <p>I am currently expecting to graduate from UC in May 2026 with my bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology with a minor in Robotics and Automation. Then in July I will start at GE Aerospace in the Operations Management Development Program. In the program I will complete 3 rotations of 8 months exposing myself to roles as an operations supervisor, a lean leader, a process engineer, and a materials planner. Each of the rotations can take place at any GE Aerospace location.
