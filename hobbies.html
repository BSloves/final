    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <div class="aboutsect">
      <h2>Disc Golf</h2>
        <div class="about_row">
          <img src="images/putter-disc-1024x684.jpg" alt="Disc golf basket" class="aboutshots">
          <p>Disc golf is a relatively new hobby of mine, spanning about 2 years now. However, I am not new to frisbee having grown up playing a ton of frisbee with my friends everyday every summer. I had played a few times a year for a while, but during my co-op rotation in fall of 2024 my co-workers got me really into it. It is now a casual hobby that I like to participate in when the weather is nice.</p>

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
      <div class="about_row">
        <img src="images/chef.jpg" alt="Pan on fire" class="aboutshots">
        <p>Throughout the first 18 years of my life, and still to this day when I am home, my dad has cooked family dinner every night. After moving away to college it became my responsiblity to actually feed myself. After a year of living off of the dining hall food, I decided to learn how to cook just as my dad did in college. </p>

    <h2>3D Modeling/Printing</h2>
      <div class="about_row">
        <img src="images/3dprinting.png" alt="3D printer" class="aboutshots">
        <p>3D modeling has been a fun hobby of mine ever since I first learned Fusion360 in 2017. It has allowed me to design and print anything from fun little knick knacks to more useful items like bag clips and load bearing L-brackets.</p>
      </div>

    <h2>Lego</h2>
      <div class="about_row">
        <img src="images/mf.jpg" alt="Millennium Falcon Lego Set" class="aboutshots">
        <p>As an engineer I feel as if an interest in Lego is a right of passage. It is definitely an expensive passage. Especially as a Star Wars fan. A few of my favorite, and also largest, sets that I have acquired recently are the UCS Millennium Falcon, the UCS R2D2, the Spider-Man Frame, and the Globe.</p>
